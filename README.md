Poppy Humanoid
===================
Poppy is an open source platform dedicated to the conception of animated robotic creature.

![Trunk Assembled](doc/img/poppy-humanoid-github.jpg)

The first and most advanced creature is the fully 3D printed Poppy Humanoid.

## Presentation

Poppy Humanoid is an open-source and 3D printed humanoid robot. Optimized for research and education purposes, its modularity allows for a wide range of applications and experimentations.

## Build your own Poppy Humanoid

Building a complete Poppy Humanoid costs $8000-9000 with about 60% for buying the 25 Robotis Dynamixel actuators required. The full BOM is available here >> [Bill Of Material](hardware/doc/BOM.md).

**The STL files are available in [the releases](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid/releases) of this repository.**

Then the process to assemble a complete Poppy Humanoid takes about 7h for  handyman people. Yet the skills required are very limited and should not be a problem for anyone able to hold a screwdriver.

The assembly process is fully documented with video tutorials.
### [Go to the Poppy Humanoid assembly documentation >>](hardware/doc/Poppy_Humanoid_assembly_instructions.md)

### Install the software tools locally
If you want to install the software tools locally and not use the embedded board to control the Robot or if you are working with the simulator, you will have to install Python. We strongly recommand using a pre-packaged distribution as [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) and install the [poppy-humanoid](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid/tree/master/software) package (the easiest way is via pip). 

For more information, you can refer to this [notebook tutorial](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/poppy-project/pypot/blob/master/samples/notebooks/Controlling%20a%20Poppy%20humanoid%20in%20V-REP%20using%20pypot.ipynb).


## Support
You need support ?
The [Poppy forum](https://forum.poppy-project.org) is the best (and single) place to ask for help !

You can in particular check for the [Poppy Humanoid category](https://forum.poppy-project.org/c/poppy-creatures/humanoid).

## Contribution

If you are interrested by contribuing to the Poppy project, you can **take a look at [open issues](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-humanoid/issues) and [call for contributions](https://forum.poppy-project.org/tags/call-for-contributions)**.

Morevover, the Poppy project involves a very large scope of disciplines: 
 - Engineering fields such as computer science, mechanics, electronics, machine learning... 
 - Humanities such as cognitive science, psychology...
 - Life science such as biology, biomechanics,...
 - Community management, scientific mediation, communication...
 - Design such as web design, object design, UX,... 
 - Art with the need of animator to create [the illusion of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Animation:_The_Illusion_of_Life) and emotions.

So there are many ways to contribute to this project and you are very welcome to do it.

Maybe the first step is to become a member of the community on the [poppy forum](https://forum.poppy-project.org).  The forum is the very central place to exchange with users and contributors. You can freely come and talk about your project or ideas with your prefered language.

## The Poppy project history

The Poppy project is born in 2012 in the [Flowers laboratory](https://flowers.inria.fr/) at [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux).
It was initiated during [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre)'s PhD Thesis surpervised by [Pierre Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). At the beginning, the development team was composed by [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre) (mechanics & design), [Pierre Rouanet](https://github.com/pierre-rouanet) (software) and [Jonathan Grizou](http://jgrizou.com/) (electronics).

This project is initially a fundamental research project financed by [ERC Grant Explorer](http://erc.europa.eu/) to explore the role of embodiement and morphology properties on cognition and especially on the learning of sensori-motor tasks.
